"""A module for (abstract) optimization problem solvers.

This module provides abstract base classes for optimization problem
solvers: `Solver` and `CompositeSolver`. The `Solver` abstract base
class defines the common interfaces of optimization problem solvers.
The `CompositeSolver` abstract base class is a subclass of `Solver`,
which is a superclass of all composite solvers. Here 'composite solver'
means a solver that solves optimization problems with using its child
solver functions. For example, a composition of an optimization problem
solver and some pre/post-processing functions is a composite solver
whose child solver is the constituent solver. Since `CompositeSolver` is
a subclass of `Solver`, clients can treat "plain" solvers and composite
solvers uniformly. See also
`composite pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern>`_.
